help me get all the commands i need to generate all the files i need to get all these files also a strat to
  get them effiently. There is like a save or tesseract to netcdf that saves the tesseract object to netcdf,
  which is what we want. Then I just need the full file path, the variable name, and then also like the
  breakpoints in the original MATLAB code that we need to set it at which I think I kind of already know. Then
  maybe a quick like verification as well. What else? I need the full file path which is like
  /cats/vsp01/something.go$.
