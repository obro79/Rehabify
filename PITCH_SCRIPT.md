# Rehabify - Pitch Script (5 Minutes)

**Target Time: 4-5 minutes total (90 seconds pitch + 3-4 minute demo)**

---

## SLIDE 1: Title - "Rehabify: Physical therapy made accessible for all" (10 seconds)

**[Stand confidently, make eye contact]**

"Hi everyone, we're Rehabify—and we're here to fix a broken part of healthcare that affects millions of people."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem We Are Facing (30 seconds)

**[Speak with personal conviction]**

"Physical therapy depends on consistent, high-quality home exercise. But here's the challenge: there's **zero visibility** for physical therapists on what happens at home between appointments.

**[Pause for effect]**

The result? Slower recovery, frustrated patients, overworked therapists, and money down the drain.

In fact, **only 35% of patients** complete their prescribed exercises—because they're unsure about their form and have no supervision at home."

---

## SLIDE 3: Transition - "The Solution" (5 seconds)

**[Confident, solution-oriented tone]**

"So what if we could close that gap?"

---

## SLIDE 4: Rehabify's Solution (45 seconds)

**[Energetic, clear delivery]**

"Rehabify closes the visibility gap in physical therapy with real-time form correction and transparent progress tracking.

Here's how it works:

**[Point to each benefit as you mention it]**

**First: Improve adherence** - Patients get instant feedback and engagement, so they actually make progress.

**Second: Increase accessibility** - No appointments or upfront costs to start rehab. Anyone with a webcam can begin.

**Third: Improve outcomes** - With form monitoring and consistent rehab, patients recover faster.

And we do all of this while prioritizing patient privacy—because your video never leaves your device."

---

## SLIDE 5: You Can Trust Us (30 seconds)

**[Address the elephant in the room—reassuring, professional tone]**

"Now, you might be thinking: 'Can I trust AI with my health?' Great question.

**[Point to each icon]**

**Exercise Library** - All exercises are sourced from NASM's evidence-based protocols, not made up by us.

**Compliance** - We're HIPAA-ready with secure data handling for video and exercise data.

**PT-in-the-Loop** - Every plan is managed and monitored by physical therapists with AI guardrails to catch issues.

We also have safety stops: if a patient reports serious symptoms during intake—like bowel issues or numbness—the system won't generate a plan. It directs them straight to in-person care."

---

## SLIDE 6: Demo (3-4 minutes)

**[This is your wow moment—be enthusiastic and smooth]**

"Alright, let me show you how this actually works."

**[Navigate to demo]**

### Demo Flow:

**Step 1: Patient View (30 seconds)**
"This is what a patient sees. I've been assigned an exercise—let's do a Standing Lumbar Flexion. I'll start the exercise, and Rehabify immediately begins analyzing my movement using just my laptop camera."

**Step 2: Skeleton Tracking (Wow Moment - 20 seconds)**
**[Show live camera with skeleton overlay]**
"Watch this—Rehabify tracks 33 body landmarks in real-time at 30 frames per second. No wearables, no sensors, no calibration. Just a standard webcam."

**[Let them see it working—pause briefly]**

**Step 3: Intentional Mistake → Instant Feedback (40 seconds)**
"Now here's where patients usually reinforce bad habits. Watch what happens when I make a common mistake."

**[Perform incorrect rep—e.g., bend knees]**

**[Wait for voice feedback: "Keep your legs straight" or visual correction]**

"Boom. Rehabify catches it instantly and tells me exactly what to fix. This is the feedback patients never get at home."

**Step 4: Correct Reps → Automatic Tracking (40 seconds)**
**[Perform 2-3 correct reps]**

"Now when I do it correctly, Rehabify counts the rep and confirms success in real-time. Only good reps count. Patients don't have to guess—they know they're doing it right."

**[Complete exercise set]**

"Once the required reps are done, the program advances automatically to the next exercise."

**Step 5: Therapist Dashboard (Most Important - 60 seconds)**
**[Switch to PT dashboard]**

"Now here's what physical therapists never get today."

**[Point to key metrics on screen]**

"Instead of asking 'Did you do your exercises?', therapists see:
- **Completion rate** - Did the patient actually do the work?
- **Form quality score** - How well did they move?
- **Problem areas** - Where are they struggling?

This is objective data on form quality, consistency, and improvement over time.

**[Pause for impact]**

PTs we surveyed said this would save them **1-2 hours per week per patient**—and 100% said it would make therapy more accessible and affordable."

## CLOSING (20 seconds)

**[Return to confident, visionary tone]**

"Rehabify doesn't replace physical therapists. It gives them superpowers—outside the clinic.

We're closing the visibility gap in physical therapy, one exercise at a time.

Thank you."

**[Smile, open for questions]**

## KEY DELIVERY TIPS:

### Tone & Energy:
- **Problem slide**: Serious, empathetic (you've been there)
- **Solution slide**: Confident, clear, solution-oriented
- **Trust slide**: Reassuring, professional
- **Demo**: Enthusiastic, smooth, let the tech speak
- **Closing**: Visionary, memorable

### Pacing:
- Speak clearly but not too fast
- Pause after big stats (35%, 1-2 hours/week, 100%)
- Let the demo breathe—don't rush through it

### Body Language:
- Make eye contact with judges
- Point to screen for visual emphasis
- Stand to the side of screen during demo so judges can see
- Use hand gestures for "three benefits" (hold up fingers)

### If Demo Fails:
"And if the demo gods aren't with us today, here's a video backup—"
**[Have backup video ready]**

### Common Questions to Prep For:

**Q: How accurate is the form detection?**
A: "We're using MediaPipe Pose from Google, which is clinical-grade. For our 3 core exercises, we've validated accuracy with licensed PTs. As we scale, we're implementing machine learning for personalization."

**Q: What's your business model?**
A: "B2B SaaS for PT clinics—$50/month per therapist, unlimited patients. We can also bill insurance under CPT code 98975 for remote therapeutic monitoring."

**Q: What about liability?**
A: "PT-in-the-Loop means every plan is overseen by a licensed therapist. We're a tool for therapists, not a replacement. Plus our safety stops catch serious symptoms before generating plans."

**Q: How is this different from YouTube videos?**
A: "YouTube doesn't watch you back. We track movement quality in real-time and give both patients AND therapists actionable feedback. That's the visibility gap no one else is closing."
